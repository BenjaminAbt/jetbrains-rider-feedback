# Thinks I like / I dont like in JetBrains Rider

## I like ‚úÖ

- Very fast IntelliSense
- ASP.NET Endpoint feature is very nice (UX should be revised)
- Git UX is muuuuuch better than the "new" VS Git integration (and overall works better)
- NuGet Explorer üòç fast, really nice UI with endpoint source, dependency tree...! Love it.
- Very nice integrated IL viewer
- Error hints in the footer
- 
## I dont like

- Markdown is not rendered properly, e.g. Tables dont work (known bug) (https://twitter.com/Abt_Benjamin/status/1424663210653847553)
- Git integration is better than VS, but still not as good as GitLens in VSCode
- Git sometimes does not work as expected (https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham/status/1425920969730924546)
- Unit Tests are buggy; while Tests Window show all tests the Unit Test Coverage is not synced all the time
- On new file there is always an extra git add automated, why?
- Font Setting Window
- Some color options are very weird (https://twitter.com/Abt_Benjamin/status/1424715191074410500/photo/1)

## I really hate üëø

- "Visual Studio" keymap is not working, it's always "IntelliJ" setting
- Git behavior is shitty, wastes a lot of spaces, too much clicks and works not like expected (https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham/status/1425920969730924546)
- Font is not good in High DPI Mode (known bug) (https://twitter.com/Abt_Benjamin/status/1424662360904568835)
- On start side bars (e.g. solution explorer) are on left side even if I move them to the right. The setting is stored inside the `.idea` folder as solution setting. Wtf?
- It wastes sooo much space in wide monitors (~40%) because Rider wraps words after 150 chars
